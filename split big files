a) Using head and tail
to split into two parts at selected line number

head -n 1000  large_file.txt > part1.txt # get top 1000 lines
tail -n +1001 large_file.txt > part2.txt # get all lines starting from lines 1001 to end of file

b) Using csplit
to split into two parts at selected line number (new first line of second part)
csplit -sf part. large_file.txt 1001
  part.00 # contains lines 1..1000
  part.01 # contains lines 1001...end
c) Using split
to split a large file into several parts of a maximal file size

split <size> <filename>  <prefix>
split -b50m large_file.txt part # split into 50MB parts

# split large uniref100.fasta file into 8 parts
pyfasta split -n 8 uniref100.fasta
